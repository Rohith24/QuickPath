# Privacy Policy for SwiftPath Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

SwiftPath is a Chrome extension that helps users bookmark and navigate to paths across different domains. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect
- **Saved Paths**: The URL paths you choose to bookmark (e.g., `/admin/login`, `/api/docs`)
- **Path Names**: Custom names you assign to saved paths
- **Current Page URLs**: Only to extract the path portion for saving (not stored permanently)

### What We DON'T Collect
- Personal information or identifiers
- Complete browsing history
- Passwords or sensitive authentication data
- Analytics, usage tracking, or behavioral data
- Data from websites you visit (beyond the path you choose to save)
- IP addresses or location data
- Device information or browser fingerprints

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
- All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API
- No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties
- No cloud storage or remote backups are created
- Data remains exclusively on your device

### Data Security Measures
- Chrome's built-in encryption protects your stored data
- Data is isolated per browser profile
- No network transmission of your saved paths
- No external API calls or data sharing

## Data Usage

Your saved paths are used exclusively for:
- Displaying your bookmarked paths in the SwiftPath popup interface
- Navigating to selected paths on the current domain when you click them
- Export functionality to create local backup files
- Import functionality to restore from local backup files

## Your Data Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

### View and Access
- See all saved paths in the SwiftPath popup
- Export all data to a JSON file for backup or review

### Modify and Delete
- Edit path names and URLs directly in the extension
- Remove individual paths at any time
- Clear all saved data with one click
- Uninstalling the extension permanently removes all data

### Data Portability
- Export your paths to a standard JSON format
- Import paths from backup files
- No vendor lock-in or proprietary formats

## Permissions Explanation

SwiftPath requests minimal permissions necessary for functionality:

### Required Permissions:
- **storage**: To save your bookmarked paths locally in Chrome's secure storage
- **activeTab**: To read the current page URL for path extraction and navigation
- **host_permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: To work on any website where you want to use saved paths

### What These Permissions Do NOT Allow:
- Reading content from web pages
- Accessing other tabs or browsing history
- Modifying website content
- Tracking your browsing behavior

## Data Retention

- **Saved Paths**: Retained until you manually delete them or uninstall the extension
- **Temporary Data**: Current page URLs are processed in memory only and not permanently stored
- **No Automatic Deletion**: Your data persists across browser sessions until you choose to remove it

## Third-Party Services

SwiftPath does not use any third-party services, analytics, or external APIs. The extension operates entirely offline after installation.

## Children's Privacy

SwiftPath does not knowingly collect any data from users under 13 years of age. The extension's functionality does not require age verification, and no personal information is collected from any users.

## International Users

Since all data is stored locally on your device, no international data transfers occur. Your data remains in your jurisdiction.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. When we do:
- The "Last Updated" date will be revised
- Significant changes will be noted in the extension's update notes
- Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

## Data Breach Response

Since no data is transmitted or stored externally, traditional data breaches are not applicable. However, if a security vulnerability in the extension itself is discovered:
- We will release a security update promptly
- Users will be notified through the Chrome Web Store update mechanism
- Recommended actions will be provided if necessary

## Contact Information

For questions, concerns, or requests regarding this privacy policy or your data:
- Contact us through the Chrome Web Store support section
- Report issues via the extension's support channels
- For urgent privacy concerns, use the Chrome Web Store developer contact methods

## Legal Compliance

This extension and privacy policy comply with:
- **Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies**
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - EU users have full control over their data
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** - California residents can access, delete, and export their data
- **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** - No data collection from children
- **Other applicable privacy laws** in jurisdictions where the extension is available

## Transparency Report

SwiftPath maintains complete transparency:
- **Data requests**: We cannot access your data, so we cannot fulfill government or third-party data requests
- **Data sharing**: Zero data sharing occurs as no data leaves your device
- **Monetization**: No advertising, tracking, or data monetization
- **Open source**: Consider making the code available for security audits

---

**Summary**: SwiftPath is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your path bookmarks never leave your device, no tracking occurs, and you maintain complete control over your data at all times.
